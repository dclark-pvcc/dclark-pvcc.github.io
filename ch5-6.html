    <td>Computer Architecture Terms:
    <ol>
        <li>RAM:(random access memory) A memory structure in which each cell has an address and it takes the same amount of time to fetch or store any cell./li>
        <li>cache: A special high-speed memory unit that keeps a copy of memory cells with a high likelihood of access in the near future.</li>
        <li>Principle of locality: The high likelihood that when a program fetches a piece of data or an instruction:
            <ol>
                <li>It will probably use it again very soon.</li>
                <li>It will probably use the "neighbors" of this item very soon.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>ROM:(Read-only memory) A memory structure that can only be accessed, not written into or changed.</li>
        <li>memory cell size: The number of bits in a single memory cell.</li>
        <li>memory cell address: The minimum unit of memory access.</li>
        <li>maximum memory size: The maximum amount of memory that a computer can physically hold.</li>
        <li>register: Used to implement the fetch and store operations.</li>
        <li>fetch: Load and decode the address into the MAR then copy the contents of that memory location into the MDR.</li>
        <li>store: Load the address into the MAR, load the value into the MDR, decode the address in the MAR, then store the contents of the MDR into that memory location.</li>
        <li>memory access time: The time it takes to fetch or store the contents of a single memory cell.</li>
        <li>DASD:(direct access storage device) A mass storage device in which each unit of information is associated with a unique address, but the time to access each piece of information may not be the same.</li>
        <li>Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU): A computer subsystem that performs such mathematical and logical operations as addition, subtraction, and comparison for equality.</li>
        <li>Control Unit: The computer subsystem that fetches and executes instructions stored in the memory of the computer.</li>

        <li>User Interface: A visual display that the operating system provides, which is in all modern operating systems.</li>
        <li>Language Services: Programs called assemblers, compilers, and interpreters, which allow users to write programs in a high-level, user-oriented language.</li>
        <li>Memory Managers: Programs that allocate memory space for programs and data and retrieve this memory space when it is no longer needed.</li>
        <li>Information Managers: Programs made to handle the organization, storage, and retrieval of information on storage devices.</li>
        <li>I/O Managers/Systems: Allow users to easily and efficiently use the many different types of input and output devices that exist on a modern computer system.</li>
        <li>Scheduler: A Program that keeps a list of programs ready to run on the processor and selects the one that will execute next. The scheduler allows users to have several different programs active at a single time.</li>
        <li>Utilities: These collections of library routines provide a wide range of useful services either to a user or to other system routines, often organized into collections called "program libraries".</li>
        <li>Assembly Language: A low-level programming language that maps 1:1 into machine language.</li>
