        <li>Problem 1: Start, label the three inputs, calculate the sum of the inputs, the average is the sum of the three divided by three, output is the average, stop. </li>
        <li>Problem 2: Start, subtract the mileage prior from the current mileage, the result is the miles driven, divide miles driven by the number of gallons of gas used, output is answer, stop. </li>

        <li> Used in designing algorithms. It uses many constructs and notations of science and math to look like a high-level programming language.</li>

        <li>To extend or fix the program in use, maintaining it.</li>
        <li>It makes it easier to understand an algorithm.</li>
        <li>The more elegant the solution, the more difficult it may be to understand, elegent solutions are clever but often trade ease of understanding.</li>
        <li>Starting at the beginning of a list and looking at each number one at a time until we either find the one were looking for or get to the end of the list.</li>

        <li>Multiple processors computes tasks into smaller parts simultaneously. Seen in supercomputers.</li>
