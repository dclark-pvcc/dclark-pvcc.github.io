        <li>The programmer can take a macroscopic view of tasks, thinking at a higher level of problem solving-The "primitive operations" used as building blocks in algorithm construction can be larger.</li>

  <tr>
    <td>Why does the textbook refer to "Tower of Babel" regarding computer languages?
    <ul>
