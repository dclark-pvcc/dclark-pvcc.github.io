    <td>Briefly describe or define:
    <ol>
        <li>Information Security: The goal of keeping information protected from those who do not have permission to access it.</li>
        <li>Authentication: The process of verifying who has the right to gain access to the computer.</li>
        <li>Authorization: Governs what an authenticated user of a computer is allowed to do.</li>
        <li>Dual Authentication: A second authentication measure after the user enters the user ID and password.</li>
        <li>Social Engineering: The process of using people to get the information you want.</li>
        <li>Virus: A computer program that embeds itself within another program or file in order to infect a host computer and then spread.</li>
        <li>Worm: Similar to a virus, but can send copies of itself to other nodes on a computer network without having to be carried by an infected host file.</li>
        <li>Trojan Horse: A computer program that does some legitimate computational task but, unbeknownst to the user, also contains code to perform malicious attacks.</li>
        <li>Ransomware: Malware that invades a user's computer, encrypts all the files, then demands a ransom payment for the files to be released.</li>
        <li>Phishing: The practice of sending emails purporting to be legimate to a large number of potential victims in the hopes of luring users to visit a fake website, where personal information can be collected.</li>
        <li>White Hat: The security experts who try to keep us safe in cyberspace</li>
        <li>Black Hat: The bad people who try to ferret out computer system weaknesses for financial gain, control, or outright destruction.</li>
        <li>Encryption/Decryption: Encryption is to make information meaningless even if someone does manage to steal it, while Decryption is the reverse.</li>
        <li>Cryptography: The science of secret writing.</li>
        <li>Symmetric Encryption Algorithm: An encryption algorithm that requires a secret key shared by sender and receiver.</li>
        <li>Caesar Cipher: An encryption algorithm that shifts each character in the message to another character some fixed distance farther along in the alphabet.</li>
        <li>Block Cipher: Any encryption algorithm that encodes a block of characters together, so that each coded character is the result of several plaintext characters.</li>
        <li>Data Encryption Standard (DES): A symmetric encryption algorithm developed in the 1970s but still widely used.</li>
        <li>Public Key System: The encryption key for messages to go to a particular receiver is broadcast to everyone, but the decryption key cannot be derived from it and is known only by the receiver.</li>
        <li>Embedded Computers: Computational devices such as chips, processors, or computers that are embedded within another system.</li>

        <li>Hard: I could not figure out how to solve this cipher, but from what I could deduce it has a lot to do with alphebetical order and scrambled letters.</li>

        <li>What do you think of Christine McCarthy and her cipher games project?: It is very well put together, the puzzles for medium and hard are very difficult.</li>
        <li>Would you recommend this site to others who might be interested in cryptography?: Absolutely, while I'm not good at it, I do like puzzles, and these are quite challenging.</li>
        <li>What do you think of Christine's code?: Christine's code is very organized, it's easy to look through.</li>
