    <ol>
        <li>computer network: A collection of independent computer systems connected together by telecommunication links, made for sharing information and resources.</li>
        <li>analog device: The voice-oriented dial-up telephone network is an example of an analog device, which are good at transmitting human voices, which vary in pitch and volume.</li>
        <li>digital device: A digital subscriber line (DSL) trasnmits digital signals, which are a sequence of 0s and 1s.</li>
        <li>modem: A device that modulates or alters a carrier, which is a standard analog signal, and encodes it into binary information.</li>
        <li>bandwidth: The capacity for transmitting data.</li>
        <li>ethernet: The most widely used broadband technology.</li>
        <li>WLAN: (wireless local area network) A wireless network that users can connect to locally, within a few hundred feet.</li>
        <li>IEEE 802.11 wireless network standard: Another name for Wi-Fi.</li>
        <li>MAN: (metropolitan area network) A larger scale WLAN, typically covering a neighborhood in size.</li>
        <li>Internet of Things: The concept of everyday objects having connection to the internet.</li>
        <li>LAN: A local area network which connects devices within close proximity.</li>
        <li>repeater: Amplifies and forwards a signal.</li>
        <li>WAN: Wide Area Networks connect devices that aren't in close proximity.</li>
        <li>packet and packet switching: An information block transmitted through the network as a single unit, which hop from nodes to reach thier destination.</li>
        <li>ISP: An internet service provider is a business which provides private access to their network.</li>
        <li>firewall: A software or hardware component that controls access from a network to a computer system.</li>
        <li>protocol: When it comes to networking, it is widely agreed upon rules, conventions, and agreements to make the exchange of information efficient and orderly.</li>
        <li>cloud computing: A computing system where data is stored and services are provided outside the view of the user. </li>
        <li>net neutrality: The idea that an Internet service provider (ISP) should treat all users, platforms, and content equally.</li>

        <li>Layer 1. Physical layer: Governs the exchange of binary digits across a physical communication channel, such as a cable, wire, or radio.</li>
        <li>Layer 2. Data link layer: Address and solve these error handling and framing.</li>
        <li>Layer 3. Network layer: Makes sure that a message is delivered from the original site to it's destination.</li>
        <li>Layer 4. Transport layer: "program-to-program" delivery service which moves messages from one specific program to another.</li>
